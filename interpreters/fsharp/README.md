# F# Implementation

BrainF*** Interpreter written in F#

By Preston Corless

## Usage

`dotnet run --configuration Release -- [FILE.bf]`

## Performance

- Has quite a few places where performance can be improved upon, does not optimize currently.
- Has terrible performance, would take several minutes to complete just the first line of `hanoi.bf` even in release mode.
